# My-sql-mini-project
Description:
This project was created to help me understand how MySQL works and how it is used by developers. I developed a Corporate Management System, which manages various entities and their attributes in a company.
The system includes entities such as:
Department
Company Name
Employees
Projects
Employee-Project Assignments

The main goal of this project was to get familiar with database concepts and operations. While working on this project, I implemented:
CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
Normalization to reduce data redundancy
Transactions to maintain data integrity
This project gave me hands-on experience with relational databases and helped me understand how entities and their relationships are managed in MySQL.
